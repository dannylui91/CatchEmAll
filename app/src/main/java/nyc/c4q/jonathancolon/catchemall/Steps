What is a service?
Service is a component which runs in the background without direct interaction with the user.
It has no user interface and not bound to any android life cycles.
IntentService class is an example of a service that we can run in a separate background thread/process even if the application is closed.

What is an AlarmManager?
Can trigger services at a specified time.

What is a BroadcastReceiver?
Used to receive a broadcast which can be triggered by the Alarm given by the AlarmManager.

What is a WakefulBroadcastReceiver?
Used to start a service when your phone boots without having the application opened.

0. In MainActivity is where you schedule and create the AlarmManager
1. Create the Service which extends IntentService -> your operations/calculations go in there
2. Create MyAlarmReceiver which extends BroadcastReceiver -> after receiving the broadcast given by the AlarmManager at the specified time, start the Service ^
3. Add to manifest within the receiver and the service
    <Application>
         ...
         <receiver
             android:name=".MyAlarmReceiver"
             android:process=":remote" >
         </receiver>

         <service
             android:name=".MyTestService"
             android:exported="false" />
    </Application>

5. To start the service on boot up you'll need to restart your phone once you implemented these steps
6. Create BootBroadcastReceiver extends WakefulBroadcastReceiver
7. Add to manifest within
   <Application>
       ...
       <receiver android:name="com.codepath.example.BootBroadcastReceiver">
           <intent-filter>
               <action android:name="android.intent.action.BOOT_COMPLETED" />
           </intent-filter>
       </receiver>
   </Application>

8. In your Service class, you'll need to add this line in your onHandleIntent() method
   WakefulBroadcastReceiver.completeWakefulIntent(intent);
   -so the device can go back to sleep after the service is launched

9. Starting a notification in your Service class -> where you write code to do your task, write code to show a notification
